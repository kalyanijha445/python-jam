Python Jam Competition: Ball Hit Detection

Project Overview:

In this project, I developed a Python-based system to detect when a tennis ball hits a framed area on a wall, visualizing the impact on a virtual screen. The system utilizes a webcam to capture the framed area and displays the detected hit on a virtual 16:9 white screen on a computer.

Core Requirements:

Frame: A 16:9 framed area created using colored tape.

* Camera: A webcam captures the framed area.

* Virtual Screen: A 16:9 white screen displayed on the computer.

Hit Detection: Detects when the ball hits within the framed area and identifies the impact point. *

* Visualization: Displays a black circle at the detected hit point on the virtual screen.

* Calibration: Maps the physical frame accurately to the virtual screen.

* Lighting Robustness: Ensures functionality in various lighting conditions.

Deliverables:

We have submitted a Python script along with documentation of our approach. The script showcases accurate hit detection with proper calibration and responsiveness under varying lighting conditions.

Evaluation Criteria:

* Hit detection accuracy

* Noise reduction techniques

* Aspect ratio maintenance

* Responsiveness to hits

*Lighting robustness

* Scalability of the solution

*Code quality and modularity

* Creativity in the approach

Additional Notes:

We have utilized Python libraries such as OpenCV for image processing, ensuring accurate hit detection and noise reduction. The code follows a modular approach, allowing flexibility and scalability.
